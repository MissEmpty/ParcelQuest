    - Buhuu... Wait, you can see me? Normally others can't see us forest spirits,
      so you must be special.
    - Maybe you can help me then? I lost my mother and cannot find her anymore. I've
      been left crying here all alone...
    - Could you look for her? I think I can still sense her presence around here...
