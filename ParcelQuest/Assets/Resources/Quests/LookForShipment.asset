    - You are working for the post office, right? Maybe you could help me then.
    - 'A shipment of goods should have arrived two days ago, but it seems like it''s
      gone missing. '
    - Could you help me and go look for it, please? I would start off in the forest,
      that's where goods usually pass through. And don't forget to check every nook
      and cranny!

    - Did you find my shipment? The forest has some hidden areas, maybe you could
      check there too.
  completedDialogue:
    lines:
    - 'You found it! It was in a cave? That is odd indeed, I wonder how it ended
      up in there. '
    - Thanks again for your help and say hello to Edna from me.
