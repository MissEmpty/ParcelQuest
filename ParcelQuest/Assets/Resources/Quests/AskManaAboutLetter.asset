  description: Ask Mana if she knows anything about the letter
  startDialogue:
    lines:
    - You want to know if I wrote this letter? Even if the writing is good, it wasn't
      me.
    - But the style reminds me of Mana. She is very shy, so she never admits it,
      but she is a great writer.
    - She also hinted to me, that she likes someone. Go ask her, but don't be too
      pushy.
    - She should be in front of her house right now, all the way tot the right.
  inProgressDialogue:
    lines:
    - Mana lives all the way on the right side of the village.
