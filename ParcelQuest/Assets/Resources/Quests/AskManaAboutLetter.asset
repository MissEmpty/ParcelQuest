  description: Ask Mana if she knows anything about the letter
  startDialogue:
    lines:
    - 'Emmett: You want to know if I wrote this letter? Even if it is very well written,
      it wasn''t me.'
    - The style reminds me a bit of Mana. She's very shy, so she would never admit
      it, but she's a good writer.
    - She also hinted to me, that she likes someone. Go ask her, but don't be too
      pushy.
    - She is currently standing in front of her house, on the far right next to the
      store.

    lines:
    - 'Emmett: Mana lives in the house to the far right of the store. She should
      be outside right now.'
