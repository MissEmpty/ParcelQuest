    - Are these the special cups for the festival? Thank you, I'm relieved they're
      finally here.
    - I'm having my hands full with preparations, so could you maybe help me? I still
      need some people to perform and provide food.
    - Maybe you could start with asking Grannie Ann if she can tell her famous stories.
      That would be great!
